<div>Summary of the day: "Do Widzenia!"</div>
<div>
    I got up early in morning and jog to Wisła river.
</div>
<div>

    On the way to the river, I met group of people walking dogs, off leash. Since doggies start to chase me, I stopped, "Go to mommy!" Owners are sorry to me, I gestured not to worry. I noticed owners had beer in their hands before 7am. Yay, Satureday!
</div>
<div>
    I ran along Wisła river, but had to turn into town because of the construction.
    Luckly, the road I had to turn was the one to Chopin museum, so I did not have to get lost from the early morning.
</div>
<div>
    There were so many of construction going on the city of Warsaw. Construction for the New metro line was happening almost across the city. I would assume they are preparing for next year, 2015, when they get many international guests, happening every 5 years for Chopin intl' competition.
</div>

    I ran across the old town, and reached Saski Park. When I saw this park a few days ago, I immediately planed to come back there in early morning time. The statue, fountains and the guards to protect the soul or unknown soldier, under the early morning sunlight was beautiful.
</div>
<div>
    After Saski park, I was to go back hotel, but all I know was westbound. I ended up with morning market, I think it was around aleja Jana Pawla and Plac Mirowski, very lively market. I was tempted to get one sausage, but cancel the thought, since I am probably not allowed to bring to U.S. meat products.
</div>
<div>
    For the last day, I visited Chopin museum one more time, saw a street performance in the weekend old town then visited to the Royal Palace.
</div>
<div>
    While enjoying oil paints of historical events and decorative, gothic style furniture, I started hearing piano music from outside. Yes, it turned out, from 4 o'clock, in front of Sigismunds' Monument, piano concert happened in that Saturday. I literary ran out the castle.
</div>
<div>
    The pianist looked like a young gentleman. He played Waltz, Mazurka, Polonaise, a minute Waltz, fantasie impromptu... most Chopin popular songs for 45 minute, including Ballad #1. Then, after 15-20 min rest, he started again with similar set list, but mixed with other favorites, such as Nocturne 9-1&9-2, Grand Waltz and Scherzo#1. He seemed to be a young student studying piano. He did fairly good job, and nice recovery :)  "Fall love with Warsaw" Facebook have his photos from that concert.
</div>
<div>
    I saw the sign indicating another concert happens next to Pomnik Adama Mickiewicza statue at 6pm, so I moved to the place to have a seat in one of the cafe around. The pianist this time was a lady in a bit more senior school grade than the previous gentleman, and I think the introduction announcement said she was student? of Paris Conservatoire. Her set list was shorter, around 4-6 songs, starting Nocturne #9-1, Ballard#3, a minute waltz...  then ending with Polonaise Fantasies. She also did good job, and nice recovery :)
</div>
<div>
    While I was listening her from a seat of nearby cafe, I saw the pianist gentleman previously played
    walking down the Krakowskie Przedmieście street by himself. Ahm... could anyone give him ride?
</div>
<div>
    When I went back to hotel, I told the front desk my check out the next day is 4am, and asked them to reserve the taxi to the airport.

    Do Widzenia, Warsaw. I enjoyed and learned a lot in that 7 days. Hard working, modest and polite people with embedded national pride. Deep history and arts based on it. The country loves music. I felt Poland is a lot like Japan.
</div>
<div>
    I would like to come back again next year, hopefully with better language skill :)
