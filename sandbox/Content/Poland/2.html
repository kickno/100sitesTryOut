<div>Summary of the day: "Old town: People here greet each other in Mazurka rhythm, then talk in Polonaise!"</div>

<div>
    Since Chopin Museums are closed on Monday, I decided to visit the spots related to Chopin, in old town.
    Arriving old town in Warsaw using Tram (at this day, I got a day pass for 15złoty, I walked toward the first destination; Honoratka, which is a cafe in fashion at the time of Chopin's day, still in business. The Cafe did not seem to be open yet, so I just walked around  between charming traditional style housings.

    Went around the old town, sewing between tiny organic pathways, I ended up with coming back to the the open area close to Tram station. I found a gentleman with white wig, almost like a Bach cosplay...  is passing flyer. He passed me the flyer, saying "English side", indicating flyers flip side is English ... its a flyer for his pipe organ concert in 20min in St. Anne. Why not. I decided go in. The ticket was 10złoty.

    Wow, I have never seen such a .... concentration of wealth.
</div>
<div>
    After the concert, I went back to Honoratoka. I ordered Zurek, and ... ah,
    "Domowe Pierogiz miesem lub Kapustai grzybami" --- mushroom and cabbage dumpling
    ( just jot down in my note from the menu, likely being misspelled)

    Listening Chopin music in a place with low ceiling, I really wanted to spend there hours. Soooo cosy.
    When I check out, I found myself not knowing the tip system. With awkwardness, I asked the waitress about it, and it is Only Cash.
    Also, I could ask "Gdzie jest toaleta?"(= Where is bathroom?)  to her.  I love when my terrible foregin language somewhat communicate with the local people!

    Walked down the street to south, I reached Saski park, where has an eternal fire with the "Tomb of unknown soldiers" is protected by two guard. I am impressed people pay respect to the people who dedicated to big cause, rather than big names.

    On the other hand, I really would like to know the name of this bird; They look like avarage out of crow + dove + seagull.
</div>
<div>
    Why ? because THEY POOPED ON ME.

        <li>Dogs are off-leash, though they are royal to owner, walking close.</li>
        <li>The check out register do not have auto-drawer like Japan or U.S. Shops have money box to keep changes.</li>
        <li>Smoking & walking :/</li>
    </ul>
